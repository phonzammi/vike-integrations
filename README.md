List of potential Vike extensions and/or Bati integrations.

Let's mostly focus on React. Although we can also consider highly profilic Vue tools such as Pinia.

**Sorted by npm downloads.**

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) ([11M](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss))
  - Bati: DONE
  - Extension: ??
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) ([4.5M](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand))
  - Bati: ??
  - Extension: [WIP](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react/pull/57/files), BLOCKED (Vike Extension should be able to add Vite plugins)

TODO:
 - Add tools to the list above
 - Implement Vike extensions and/or Bati integrations, depending on:
   - How popular is the tool?
   - Is it easy to add it to Bati?
   - Does it make sense to implement a Vike extension?
